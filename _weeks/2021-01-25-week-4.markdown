title: "Week 4"
---
- Tahoe (where we currently live during this pannie-d) got a ton of snow this week, so I've been in winter mode. Went skiing on Friday, went snowshoeing on Sunday. My calves are on fire. Skiing is pretty safe; everyone is wearing masks, they've closed all the
lodges, and tbh nobody should be within 6 feet of me skiing on a good day.

- I can tell when I accidentally overdo it with the hobbies (which is every time I get excited about a new hobby) because I rapidly swing in the other
direction. I painted nothing this week, and I spent all weekend watching the entire season of Bling Empire in one day instead.

- I knitted most of a
[hat](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/quick-ombre-hat)
and then unravelled it all because it had accumulated too many mistakes. It's a really fun
knit so I'm not too bothered.

- I spent a lot of evenings frantically working on a visualization about plastic waste (new hobby alert) that nobody asked for. It started as "lemme do a quick thing to get better at d3 and
at asking questions about the data" and it's now a good 8+ hours of work in. Sure wish I would've half assed it, because now it's not done and I don't really want to finish it.

- Still reading ["Because Internet"](https://gretchenmcculloch.com/book/); also started
[The Travelling Cat Chronicles](https://www.amazon.com/Travelling-Cat-Chronicles-Hiro-Arikawa/dp/0451491335).

- I am really [irritated and confused](https://twitter.com/notwaldorf/status/1354298108083990528?s=20) by this Hangouts/Chat situation. I am on an iPhone, and
want to send [Frances](https://fberriman.com/) stupid links, hot takes and photos. We can't use our respective
phone's Messages app (because hers is over SMS which shits the bed on photos, and mine is Apple proprietary). We
were using Hangouts, but it's deprecated, and wanted to use Chat, but it's ...
enterprise only and peons can't start new conversations? Also Whatsapp is evil and
Signal spams all my contacts when I install it. What the fuck, I just want to talk
to non-Apple friends in 2021.

- February is a perfect calendar [rectangle](https://twitter.com/standupmaths/status/1356212992669589504?s=20) and that is satisfying.

- Are week notes the new LiveJournal but without comments? Discuss.
